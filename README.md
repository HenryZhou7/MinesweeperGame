# MinesweeperGame
A simplified minesweeper game built during coffee-breaks during internships at Baidu

This is a game that I built using the time of coffee breaks in Baidu.
To make the implementation process as fast as possible, I didn't integrate a GUI along with it.

I will be using it an Android game when I have time.
