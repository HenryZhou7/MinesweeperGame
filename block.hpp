 * The class for the block for the grid
 * Each block has the property which is consistent throughout the game
 *                          If there is a mine in the block
 *                          How many mines are around the block
 *                the status that keeps updating through game-playing
 *                          Was the block dugged before
 *                          Was the block flagged before
